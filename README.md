# The-City-of-Dreams

I wanted to try and make a clock that would look cool. Although it looks cool you simply would not be able to tell the actual time if that is what you are looking for. 
I made it so that the car moves every second, the moon moves every hour, and the clouds move every minute. I really like the 8-bit aesthetic that I have used for other class assignments so I wanted to do the same for this one. I tried to work on my commenting for this assignment more than I have in the past, which was actaully very helpfull in the long run.
